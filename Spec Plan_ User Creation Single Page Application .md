# **Spec Plan: User Creation Single Page Application (AI-Optimized)**

Version: 1.2  
Date: July 16, 2024  
Standard: Optimized for AI-Assisted Development (e.g., Amazon Q)

## **1\. Requirement Specification**

### **1.1. Introduction**

This document outlines the requirements for building a single-page application (SPA) for user creation. The specifications are formatted as user stories with explicit acceptance criteria to ensure clarity for both human developers and AI assistants.

### **1.2. User Stories and Acceptance Criteria**

**User Story 1: Form Display**

As a site administrator,  
I want to see a user creation form,  
So that I can begin entering new user details.

* **Acceptance Criteria (AC):**  
  * **AC 1.1:** The UI must render a form containing a text input field labeled "First Name".  
  * **AC 1.2:** The UI must render a text input field labeled "Last Name".  
  * **AC 1.3:** The UI must render a text input field labeled "Email Address".  
  * **AC 1.4:** The UI must render a button with the text "Create User".

**User Story 2: Form Validation**

As a site administrator,  
I want the form to validate my input before submission,  
So that I don't send incomplete or invalid data to the system.

* **Acceptance Criteria (AC):**  
  * **AC 2.1:** If the "Create User" button is clicked while the "First Name" field is empty, a validation message "First Name is required" must appear next to the field.  
  * **AC 2.2:** If the "Create User" button is clicked while the "Last Name" field is empty, a validation message "Last Name is required" must appear next to the field.  
  * **AC 2.3:** If the "Create User" button is clicked while the "Email Address" field is empty, a validation message "Email Address is required" must appear next to the field.  
  * **AC 2.4:** If the "Create User" button is clicked and the text in the "Email Address" field does not match a standard email format (e.g., user@domain.com), a validation message "Please enter a valid email address" must appear.  
  * **AC 2.5:** The API POST request must not be triggered if any of the above validation criteria are not met.

**User Story 3: Successful Submission**

As a site administrator,  
I want to submit the form and receive a confirmation,  
So that I know the user was created successfully.

* **Acceptance Criteria (AC):**  
  * **AC 3.1:** When valid data is entered in all fields and the "Create User" button is clicked, a POST request must be sent to the defined API endpoint (VITE\_API\_URL).  
  * **AC 3.2:** The body of the POST request must be a JSON object with keys firstName, lastName, and email.  
  * **AC 3.3:** Upon receiving a successful response from the API (HTTP 201), the form should be cleared or disabled.  
  * **AC 3.4:** A clear success message, such as "User created successfully\!", must be displayed to the user.

**User Story 4: Submission Failure**

As a site administrator,  
I want to be notified if the system fails to create a user,  
So that I can understand there was a problem and try again later.

* **Acceptance Criteria (AC):**  
  * **AC 4.1:** If the API call fails (e.g., network error, server returns 4xx/5xx status), a generic service error message must be displayed, such as "An error occurred while creating the user. Please try again later.".  
  * **AC 4.2:** The error message should be dismissible or disappear after a short period.

### **1.3. Non-Functional Requirements**

* **NFR-001: Technology Stack:** ReactJS, Vite, Material-UI (MUI), Storybook.  
* **NFR-002: Performance:** The application must have a fast initial load time and a responsive UI.  
* **NFR-003: Usability:** The interface must be clean, modern, and intuitive.  
* **NFR-004: Browser Compatibility:** The application must be compatible with the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.

## **2\. Architecture & Development Documentation**

### **2.1. High-Level Architecture**

The application will follow a component-based architecture.

    style D fill:\#ccf,stroke:\#333,stroke-width:2px

### **2.2. Development Setup**

1. **Project Initialization:** npm create vite@latest my-user-app \-- \--template react  
2. **Dependencies:** npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled and npx storybook@latest init  
3. **Folder Structure:**  
   /src  
   |-- /components/UserCreationForm  
   |   |-- UserCreationForm.jsx  
   |   |-- UserCreationForm.stories.jsx  
   |   |-- UserCreationForm.test.jsx  
   |-- /services/api.js  
   |-- App.jsx  
   |-- main.jsx

## **3\. Development Specification**

### **3.1. UserCreationForm.jsx Component**

* **State Management:** Use useState hooks for form input values, validation errors, and submission status.  
* **UI Components (Material-UI):** \<Box\>, \<Typography\>, \<TextField\>, \<Button\>, \<Alert\>/\<Snackbar\>.  
* **Validation Logic:** Implement a validate function triggered on submit.

### **3.2. API Service and Contract**

#### **api.js Service**

* Export an async function createUser(userData) that encapsulates the fetch logic.

#### **API Contract**

* **Endpoint:** VITE\_API\_URL (from environment variables)  
* **Method:** POST  
* **Request Body:**  
  {  
    "firstName": "string",  
    "lastName": "string",  
    "email": "string"  
  }

* **Success Response:**  
  * **Status Code:** 201 Created  
  * **Body:**  
    {  
      "userId": "string",  
      "message": "User created successfully"  
    }

* **Error Responses:**  
  * **Status Code:** 400 Bad Request (For client-side validation errors like a malformed email or if the email already exists.)  
  * **Body:**  
    {  
      "error": "Validation Error",  
      "message": "A detailed error message about what failed."  
    }

  * **Status Code:** 500 Internal Server Error (For general server-side failures.)  
  * **Body:**  
    {  
      "error": "Server Error",  
      "message": "An unexpected error occurred on the server."  
    }

### **3.3. Storybook Stories**

* Create stories for UserCreationForm covering all states defined in the acceptance criteria: default, validation errors, loading, success, and API error.

## **4\. Test Specification**

### **4.1. Automation Testing Strategy**

* **Tools:** Vitest, React Testing Library, vi.fn() for mocking.  
* **Coverage:** Each Acceptance Criterion (AC) in section 1.2 must have a corresponding automated test to verify its implementation.

### **4.2. Test Management with Zephyr**

* **Test Case Mapping:** Each AC (e.g., AC 2.1) will be a separate test case in Zephyr.  
* **Traceability:** Link Jira user stories to their corresponding test cases in Zephyr.  
* **Automation Hooks:** Configure the CI pipeline to push test results from Vitest to Zephyr Test Cycles via the Zephyr API.
